As has already been said in a million other reviews, Black Panther is a refreshing, unconventional, balanced and poignant super-hero film. It breaks both the stereotypes of how black people and women are portrayed in most super-hero films. What we take away from the movie is not an image of a superhero casting down his enemies and awing us with his grandiloquent powers and personality (think Iron Man and Captain America). T’Challa (Black Panther) does not carry the weight of the world on his own shoulders. He is superbly assisted throughout by strong and equally visible female characters. Delightfully vocal is his little sister who does not submit herself to playing second fiddle to her brother, the King. She holds her own in not just a male-dominated movie genre, but does so by being brilliant at a male-dominated industry - technology. She unflinchingly uses 'I' to describe various gadgets and their features in her lab. T’Challa’s love interest is a lot more than just a way to showcase his sensitive side. She has her own aspirations of how she wants to lead her life and do her part in helping people. Her love for T’Challa does not tie her to his side.

  Okoya is a dutiful female general and is described as the ‘greatest warrior in Wakanda’ at which point it might be hard for women watching the film to resist feeling a tinge of pride. T’Challa’s mother too has a few memorable lines of her own which speak to her sense of empowerment and comfort in being a female leader. Coming to the the main themes of the movie, it is basically a game of thrones between various men who have very different ideas of how the gifted kingdom ought to conduct itself in the world. Being a predominantly black film, Black Panther does not, in any way, portray any one of the multiple tribes as crude, coarse or barbaric. In stead, the movie raises sincere questions and debates in viewer’s minds on black people and how a hypothetical powerful black country ought to take a call on helping other black people whom they may or may not see as their own. It also sparks the ethical debate of futuristic technologies and how this knowledge should be shared with the rest of humankind. It is a uniquely difficult situation to be in and the characters in the movie present multiple ways of their own on how things ought to be run.

  Our hero is a principled and protective king who is reluctant to send out weapons to wage wars in outside countries. In contrast is his long lost cousin who comes back to claim the throne so that the weapons can be used to further his extremist cause of taking down “oppresors” and their children. While the battle is predictable, the movie does maintain viewer’s interest in the storyline mainly because we get engrossed in the characters, the culture, the musical themes and some action sequences which are a class act. The creators even managed to intersperse some timely comedic quips which drew laughs from the audience. The cast too was flawless and every character was played with conviction. It is neither heavy-weight nor breezy and seems to have found a perfect balance between the two. Black Panther is a movie worth watching especially after a bout of not-so-impressive movies in this genre. It also stands out as a shining example of a high-grossing movie which does so despite defying conventions. All this was directed by a 31-year old who happens to have his own colourful rags to riches story which adds another dimension to the movie.
