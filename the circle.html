This movie follows the journey of a young professional, Mae, who joins a giant tech company, think Google/Facebook, named The Circle. She is hired as a sort of a customer care executive but eventually brings diligence and ideas to the table with her involvement in the company meetings. Although initially reserved, Mae embraces the Circle and its culture as the movie progresses. She learns of an experimental concept at the company which propagates complete transparency of a person’s life. The idea creates buzz due to its potential ability to create an air of open decision making in board rooms and political meetings. Mae espouses the concept and broadcasts her everyday life to the world. This carefree and innocuous move quickly transitioning into the dark side effects of technology reminiscent of Black Mirror. The underlying technology in itself is not novel. Anyone today can choose to broadcast their daily life, legalities aside, through webcams or smartphones. Facebook live/Instagram live are already being used, although on a smaller scale, to achieve this. The Circle takes this idea and portrays the pitfalls through a case study which is what makes it worth a watch. The concept described above is just one-third of the movie and a similar yin-yang scenario of bigger and a more controversial product of The Circle is explored.

  SeeChange is a program through which The Circle can literally watch everything going on in the world (at least as far as their cameras can reach). We see it initially being used for altruistic purposes such as finding escaped convicts and even saving Mae’s life during a boating fiasco. This boundary-breaking tech, in predictable fashion, quickly proves to be detrimental when used in a different scenario shattering Mae’s starry-eyed fascination with the product and its capabilities (after all, ‘Big Brother is watching’ does not have a positive connotation to it). While the movie itself is not heavy-weight given the potential of the darkness it embarks upon, it does trigger the debate of the extent of permeation of technology into our midst and the kinds of limits in terms of privacy/consent that need to be in place to make it legally / politically / ethically / morally / human-rights-ly appropriate. There are numerous contributions to the dark cloud (pun-unintended) created by the way technology has grown without users being conscious of it. The myriad of permissions requested by almost every Mobile App which we download can cause an anxiety-prone luddite to lose sleep over the discomfort of sharing personal data. Data is used without users realising it because who really has the time to read fine print?

  But headlines are quick to sensationalise such issues For example, Uber, enough said. The movie touches the issue of consent by raising sympathy for characters such as Mae’s parents and her friend, Mercer, whose lives she inadvertently broadcasts without their consent leading to devastating consequences. The reviews have not been too kind to the movie, especially since it has been inevitably compared to the book and seldom has a film been able to live up to those expectations. However, those of us who have not read the book can pick up the remote and sit through the movie which is light-weight and yet attempts to tackle nefarious aspects of very real world scenarios. The movie is subjective, i.e., it can be easily forgotten by someone who does not take the thread that the movie offers and pull at it by reflecting on the side effects of technology. However, for those viewers who have not been living under a rock, it provides momentum/serves as a reminder of the potential ghastliness in store if the makers of technology are given free rein. Hollywood has picked up this theme and produced a spectrum of movies/TV shows which have been ahead of their time but point to an extant phenomenon. Technology itself is a marvel. How it is used and by whom is a topic so vast it cannot be covered by a two-hour movie.
