The Internship is a light-hearted comedy and a kind of bizarre coming-of-age film depicting two middle-aged guys adapting to the world of millenials. Billy and Nick, played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, are two successful salesmen who get laid off due to their watch company shutting shop. They confront their boss who convinces them that their selling skills are ancient and irrelevant in today’s gizmo riddled digital world. Billy take his words to heart and instead of applying to myriad other sales jobs, which despite what they are made to believe are available in abundance, applies for an internship in Google. He tries his luck just because it was staring back at him from his screen and voila! They get an interview. The job application-to-interview conversion ratio is exceptional here. Anyway, they bullshit their way through the interview as a lot of us have done at some point in our lives. This makes them likeable for a minute for the first time since the movie opens.

  The panel at Google is reluctant but one techie’s speech on entertaining diverse thinking tips the scales in their favour. Billy and Nick find themselves mesmerised by the Google campus but at the same time rebuffed by their younger immature peers. Hereon start a series of challenges which the interns must face in order to win a permanent position at the company. Predictably the leftovers are doled together to form the rest of Billy and Nick’s team and predictably they ace most of the challenges despite all odds and expectations using their ‘diverse thinking’. All this would have made for a depressingly familiar feel-good movie where the underdog wins but for some element of saving grace which makes you forgive the film. An example is the scene with Vince Vaughn and Josh Gad (who is credited as ‘Headphones’) where the latter puts things in refreshing perspective by pointing out that technical skills can be learnt but people skills are more valuable.

  Another element which deserves a mention is the relationship between the two leading men and their easy but supportive friendship throughout. Apart from this the movie offers up the same old characters - an uptight and competitive arch-enemy who is taught a lesson, an awkward nerd who can’t get the hot girl but somehow does, a prudish but good-hearted boss who warms up to the protagonists in the end. The dialogue descends into ramble quite frequently but weirdly enough that is what keeps the movie going. Some quality could have been salvaged had the writers put more efforts into the speech rather than going with the flow. Vaughn himself is one of the writers and seems to be improvising on screen while Wilson never says anything of particular significance. All in all, watch it for some mild perspective on work place environments and diversity especially in tech-companies. If you’re looking for a meaningful heavy-weight watch, this can be given a miss.
